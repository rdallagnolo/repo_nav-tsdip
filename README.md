# In-sea sound velocity dashboard

Displaying TSDip profiles with python, plotly and streamlit in a dashboard.

## General strucure

Sound velocity profiles have to be exported in the MiniSoft SD200W software as a list using `tab` as a the delimiter and `DOS` as file type. That will create a `.prn` file. Rename the file to the name you want to display in the dashboard. Try to follow some sort of logic structure as `TSDip-1.txt` or equivalent.

> **Warning**
> It is important to replace the `.prn` with a `txt`.
